#### Video Demo: [https://tinyurl.com/yh64kvts]  
#### Description:  

**Think U Next** is a desktop application built using Python and Tkinter, designed to help students prepare for exams by offering an interactive and personalized study experience. The program provides tools for creating custom question sets, reviewing pre-built problem sets, tracking progress, and managing study materials. With a user-friendly interface, students can focus on learning without distractions or complicated navigation.  

The application enables users to create their own question-answer sets, edit them, and organize them for future use. During review sessions, questions are randomized to encourage active recall and prevent rote memorization. The program also tracks performance, displaying correct and incorrect answers to help users identify areas needing improvement.

Session history is another valuable feature, logging previous sessions so students can monitor their progress over time. The graphical user interface, designed with Tkinter, ensures that the program is lightweight and easy to operate, making it accessible even to those unfamiliar with complex software.  

The project comprises several files. The main file, `project.py`, contains the core logic for the application, including the Tkinter GUI, question randomization, score calculation, and session history management. The `test_project.py` file includes unit tests to ensure the reliability of essential features such as question randomization and scoring. A `requirements.txt` file lists the dependencies, although Tkinter is included in standard Python installations.  

The program's design emphasizes simplicity and functionality. Tkinter was chosen for its ease of use and seamless integration with Python. Features like randomization of questions and session logging were implemented to make the learning process dynamic and rewarding. Balancing the design of the GUI to ensure both functionality and aesthetics was a key challenge, along with creating a system for saving and loading user-created sets reliably.  

Future enhancements for Think-U Next include improving the analytics features to give users deeper insights into their performance, adding options to import and export question sets for better customization, and gamifying the learning experience through rewards and achievements. These improvements aim to make the application even more engaging and versatile.  

**Think U Next** is more than just a study tool; it’s a platform for personalized learning and effective exam preparation. By combining the flexibility of Python with the simplicity of Tkinter, the program offers students a reliable and efficient way to master their lessons.
